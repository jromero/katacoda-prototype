First, we'll start off with a `buildpack.toml`.

This file describes the buildpack in order for `pack` to be able to use it. 

Copy the following into your new `buildpack.toml` file:

```
# Buildpack API version
api = "0.2"

# Buildpack ID and metadata
[buildpack]
id = "io.buildpacks.samples.ruby-bundler"
version = "0.0.1"
name = "Sample Ruby Buildpack"

# Stacks that the buildpack will work with
[[stacks]]
id = "io.buildpacks.samples.stacks.bionic"
```{{copy}}

You will notice two specific fields in the file: `buildpack.id` and `stack.id`.

- The buildpack ID is the way you will reference the buildpack when you create buildpack groups, builders, etc.
- The stack ID is the root file system in which the buildpack will be run. This example runs 
on a [sample stack](https://github.com/buildpack/samples/tree/master/stacks).
