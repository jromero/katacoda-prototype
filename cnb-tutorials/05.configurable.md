First, we'll start off with a `buildpack.toml`.


This file must exist in the root directory of your buildpack so the `pack` CLI knows it is a buildpack and it can apply 
the build lifecycle to it.

Create the buildpack.toml file and copy the following into it:

```
# Buildpack API version
api = "0.2"

# Buildpack ID and metadata
[buildpack]
id = "com.examples.buildpacks.ruby"
version = "0.0.1"
name = "Ruby Buildpack"

# Stacks that the buildpack will work with
[[stacks]]
id = "io.buildpacks.samples.stacks.bionic"
```{{copy}}
