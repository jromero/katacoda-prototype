Next, you will need to create the `detect` script. This is an executable that determines whether your buildpack
will be able to build the app.

```
mkdir ruby-buildpack/bin/
touch ruby-buildpack/bin/detect
chmod +x ruby-buildpack/bin/detect
```{{execute}}

For a Ruby app, you will need to check for a `Gemfile` in `detect`. 

Copy the following into the `detect`:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -eo pipefail
  
if [[ ! -f Gemfile ]]; then
  exit 100
fi

exit 0
```{{copy}}

The exit code from the `detect` executable does have meaning. Here's a quick look:

| exit code       | description                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 0               | buildpack CAN be applied to this buildpack    |
| 100             | buildpack CANNOT be applied to this buildpack |
| (anything else) | an unexpected error occurred                  |

We can try to test our buildpack by running the following command:

`pack build myapp --buildpack ruby-buildpack --path ruby-app`{{execute}}

> **NOTE:** It might take a bit as it downloads the [builder](https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/builder/) image.

You should see that detection passes but build fails:

```
...

```

> **NOTE:** `pack` is configured to use the [sample builder](https://github.com/buildpack/samples/tree/master/builders).
